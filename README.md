## Description

Counterattacking is one of the most effective strategies for scoring in modern soccer, employed by top coaches like José Mourinho, Diego Simeone, and Carlo Ancelotti. A successful counterattack relies on key player actions and team coordination, making it essential to quantify individual contributions in these scenarios. To address this, we introduce **CounterEval**, a novel deep learning framework utilizing **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to evaluate player performance during counterattacks using real-time tracking data.

CounterEval combines player movement prediction with tactical success analysis, providing a performance metric that isolates and quantifies each player’s influence on counterattack success.

## Reproduce our work

### Virtual Environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sds625_soccer
```

### Run All Results

You can get all results of this project by running one of the two following commands.

```
Rscript scripts/Main.R # Option 1
# bash scripts/Main.sh # Option 2
```

### Data

#### Raw Datasets

The raw tracking dataset, sourced from [ussf\_ssac\_23\_soccer\_gnn](https://github.com/USSoccerFederation/ussf_ssac_23_soccer_gnn), contains player and ball tracking data for 632 games. Each frame of data is represented as a graph with **nodes** (players and the ball) and **edges** (spatial and temporal relationships). However, the raw dataset contains significant noise:
- Mislabeled counterattack outcomes.
- Unrealistic player and ball movements.
- Incorrect attacking team flags.

The Graph configuration is depicted by the graph below:

To download all raw datasets for our project, run the following command.

```
bash scripts/get_raw_dataset.sh
```

#### Data Cleaning
1. **Error Identification:**
   - Visualize counterattacks using an interactive Streamlit app for manual inspection.
2. **Outcome and Flag Correction:**
   - Correct mislabeled counterattack outcomes and attacking team flags.
3. **Movement Anomalies:**
   - Identify and remove unrealistic player or ball movements (e.g., stationary ball for extended periods).
4. **Graph Representation:**
   - Transform the data into a **fully connected homogeneous graph**:
     - Nodes represent players and the ball.
     - Edges represent all pairwise relationships to facilitate GNN attention mechanisms.
   - **Edge features** are excluded as they are derived from node features and provide no additional information.

### Visualization

We also provide a streamlit app to visualize the counterattack process to facilitate our EDA. 

```
streamlit run scripts/visualize_helper.py
```

# Methodology

The **CounterEval** framework evaluates player contributions during soccer counterattacks using a combination of movement prediction and tactical analysis, implemented through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the methodology.

## 1. Player Movement Prediction with Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

To model player movements under counterattack scenarios, we employ a **Transformer-enhanced VAE**. The model predicts the next plausible locations of players given the current game context, serving as a baseline for counterfactual comparisons.

### Architecture:
1. **Input:**
   - Current player location $(x_t, y_t)$.
   - Contextual features $\theta(t-1)$ including positional and kinematic data of all players.
2. **Encoder:**
   - Maps the input to a latent space, outputting parameters $\mu$ and $\log \sigma$ for a 2D Gaussian distribution.
3. **Reparameterization:**
   - Samples latent variable $ z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) $.
4. **Decoder:**
   - Combines $z$ with contextual embeddings generated by a Transformer network to predict the player’s next location.
5. **Loss Function:**
   - The model is trained using the **reconstruction loss** (Mean Squared Error) combined with a **KL-divergence loss**:
     \[
     \mathcal{L} = \text{MSE}(\hat{l_t}, l_t) + \text{KL} \big( q(z \mid l_t) \parallel p(z) \big).
     \]

### Output:
- Predicted player locations that serve as a proxy for "average" player movements under similar conditions.

## 2. Tactical Analysis with Graph Attention Networks (GAT)

To evaluate the success probability of a counterattack, we develop a **GAT-based tactical analysis model** that processes tracking data as a fully connected graph.

### Graph Representation:
- **Nodes:** Represent players and the ball.
- **Node Features:**
   - Position: $x, y$, velocity components: $v_x, v_y$, and derived metrics such as distance/angle to goal and ball.
   - Team flag (attacking or defending) and potential receiver indicator.
- **Edges:** Fully connected edges to enable global player interactions.

### Model Architecture:
1. **Input Graph:**
   - Fully connected graph $G = (V, E)$ with player nodes $v \in V$ and edges $e \in E$.
2. **Graph Attention Mechanism:**
   - Attention coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are computed to assign importance to neighboring nodes:
     \[
     \alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left( \text{LeakyReLU} \left( a^T [W X_i \| W X_j] \right) \right)}{\sum_{k \in N_i} \exp\left( \text{LeakyReLU} \left( a^T [W X_i \| W X_k] \right) \right)}.
     \]
3. **Node Embeddings:**
   - Aggregated node embeddings are generated using the attention weights.
4. **Output Layer:**
   - A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) maps the node embeddings to predict the probability of counterattack success.
5. **Loss Function:**
   - Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss:
     \[
     \mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \Big[ y_i \log \hat{y}_i + (1 - y_i) \log (1 - \hat{y}_i) \Big].
     \]

## 3. CounterEval Contribution Score

The **CounterEval Contribution Score** measures the impact of individual players on the success of a counterattack by comparing their actual movements to predicted baseline movements.

### Steps to Compute Contribution Scores:

1. **Baseline Movement Prediction:**
   - Use the VAE-based movement model to predict a plausible "average" location for a player.
2. **Counterfactual Analysis:**
   - Replace the actual position of a player with the predicted position from the movement model while holding all other players' positions fixed.
3. **Evaluate Success Probability:**
   - Compute the counterattack success probability for both:
     - The actual observed game state $P_{\text{actual}}$,
     - The counterfactual game state $P_{\text{counterfactual}}$.
4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The player’s contribution score is defined as the difference in success probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Score}(p, t) = P_{\text{actual}} - P_{\text{counterfactual}}.
     \]
   - A **positive score** indicates that the player’s action increased the likelihood of success, while a **negative score** suggests the opposite.

5. **Event-Level Performance:**
   - Aggregate tick-level scores over the duration of a counterattack event $[t_1, t_2]$:
     \[
     M(p) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \text{Score}(p, t).
     \]

## 4. Model Training and Evaluation Pipeline

The overall pipeline ensures robust model development and evaluation:

- **Data Preparation:**
   - Clean and preprocess raw tracking data.
   - Represent each frame as a graph with node features.
- **Training:**
   - Train the VAE for movement prediction using MSE loss.
   - Train the GAT for counterattack success prediction using BCE loss.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Use grid search and Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **Movement Prediction:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - **Counterattack Success Prediction:** Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Player-level contribution scores.


## Summary

The CounterEval framework combines player movement prediction with tactical analysis to evaluate contributions during counterattacks. By isolating individual player actions through counterfactual analysis, the framework provides a systematic, data-driven approach for performance evaluation. This methodology not only identifies key contributors but also offers actionable insights for coaching and player development.
