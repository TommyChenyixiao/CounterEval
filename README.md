## Description

Counterattacking is an effective strategy for scoring in modern football, championed by renowned coaches like José Mourinho, Diego Simeone, and Carlo Ancelotti. A successful counterattack is often executed by key players, making it valuable to develop metrics that evaluate individual contributions to the play. Given the complexities of real-time tracking data, we propose a GNN-based approach to assess players’ contributions in counterattacks, which we call **CounterEval**.
