## Description

Counterattacking is an effective strategy for scoring in modern football, championed by renowned coaches like José Mourinho, Diego Simeone, and Carlo Ancelotti. A successful counterattack is often executed by key players, making it valuable to develop metrics that evaluate individual contributions to the play. Given the complexities of real-time tracking data, we propose a GNN-based approach to assess players’ contributions in counterattacks, which we call **CounterEval**.

## Reproduce our work

### Virtual Environment

```
conda create -f environment.yml
conda activate sds625_soccer
```

### Run All Results

You can get all results of this project by running one of the two following commands.

```
Rscript scripts/Main.R # Option 1
# bash scripts/Main.sh # Option 2
```

### Data

#### Raw Datasets

The source of the raw dataset is [ussf_ssac_23_soccer_gnn](https://github.com/USSoccerFederation/ussf_ssac_23_soccer_gnn). However, the data quality of this dataset is very low. Most other soccer tracking data is not free in the market and we advocate for more open access to high-quality soccer tracking data to facilitate research and development in this field.

To download all raw datasets for our project, run the following command.

```
bash scripts/get_raw_dataset.sh
```

#### Data Cleaning

### Visualization

We also provide a streamlit app to visualize the counterattack process to facilitate our EDA. 

```
streamlit run scripts/visualize_helper.py
```
